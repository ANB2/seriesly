# A Timeseries Database

seriesly is a database for storing and querying time series data.
Unlike databases like RRDtool, it's schemaless so you can just lob
data into it and start hacking.  However, it also doesn't use a finite
amount of space.  Tradeoffs.

Docs are being built out in [the wiki][wiki].
